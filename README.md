# LED-Driver
<p>Spring-Summer 2016</p>
<p>This program was designed to drive a strip of RGB LEDs for my window.</p>
<p>It interacts with a custom Arduino shield containing a photoresistor, a bank of DIP switches (with PISO shift register), a transisor for each of the 3 LED channels, and a photoresistor.</p>
<p>Of particular utility was the photoresistor, as it allows the board to adapt the brightness of the lights to the brightness of the room, meaning that no matter the time of day, the lights were always visible, but not distractingly bright.</p>
